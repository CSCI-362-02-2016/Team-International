#TEAM-INTERNATIONAL REPOSITORY
This repository is a study in designing and implementing a testing framework for an open-source project found on GitHub. Our team chose to work on the Celestia space simulation app, which can be cloned from [Celestia-g2](https://github.com/bgodard/celestia-g2), a repository created by user bgodard.

##CONTENTS
* TestAutomation folder - here is where the test cases, scripts, Celestia-g2 libraries, and project executables are located.
* Team Deliverables - currently, we have deliverables #1-4 uploaded. These reports are part of our final report, which will be posted at the end of the semester.
* Practice folders - these folders are our workspaces and will most likely be deleted at the conclusion of this project, but they are currently up so that the team can look back at previously implemented methods.

##AUTHORS
* Tony Tang
